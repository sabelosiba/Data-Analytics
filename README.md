# The basic of Data
  ## What is Data Analytics
  - is to examine and transform raw data into actionable insights that guide inforemed decision-making processess within an orgarnisation.
  - key responsibilities and skills
    - Data Collection and Preparation - sourcing data, cleaning and organizing data
    - Data aanlysis - employing statistical methods, ML techniques to interpret data, Identify trends and patterns not obvious.
    - Data visualization - creating visual presentations of data eg. charts and dashboards to make complex information easily understandable.
    - Decision Support - make recommendations based on data-driven insights guiding besiness decisions
    - Collaboration and Communication - collaborate with other ddepartements to understand their data needs and effectively communicate complex data findings to non-technical stakeholders.
    - Continuous Learning and Adaptation - keeping up-to=date with latest trends and adapt to new analytiacl model and methods.

  TASK 
  - Data Analyst 
    - Maths and Stats
    - python and sql
    - data collection , data analysis, data visualisation
    - collaboration and communication, continuous learning and adaptation
         
  3 major piilars that allow analytics programs to thrive : Data, Storage and Computing power.

  ## The Analytics Process
  - The process is iterative rather than sequantial as you can return/revisit to any stage if theres a error in your data.
  - AI :
  - ML :
  - Deep Learning :
     
  ## Data Governance
  - is the slab of stone that supports the 3 pillars.
  - ensure that the organization has high-quality data and is able to effectively control that data.

    ### Analytics tools
    - automate data analysis, improving ability to acquire, clean, manipulate, visualize and analyze data.

# Understand Data
  ## Data Types
  - a data element is an attribute about a person, place. they describe characteristics of activities.
  - data type limits the values a data element can have.

  ## Structures data types
  - is tabular data like a spreadsheet.
  - character data types limits data entry to only valid characters.
  
  #3 Unstructured
  - is any type of data that does not fit neatly into the tabular model.
  - eg. digital images, audio and video recordings
  - storing unstructured data
    - binary

  ## Categories of data
  - Quantitative (How much/many?) vs Qualitative Data (What/why?)
  - Discrete vs Countinuous Data
    - discreete represent measurements that cant be subdivided. eg. whole number
    - Countinuous can represent measure of average and have decimal 
    - Quantitative (can be both), but Qualitative is discrete
  - Categorical Data
    - Text data with known, finite number of categories
  - Dimensional Data
    - is an approach to arranging data to facilitate analysis.
   
  ## Common Structures
  ### Structured data
  - Tabular data is structured data with values stored in consistent manner and organized into rows and columns. facilitates aggregation
  - specify a unique key to identify values in a row

  ### Unstructured
  - is qualitative, describing the characteristics of an event or object.
  - eg. images, audio , video and descriptive text
  - machine data is common source of unstructured data as machines operates they create a digital footprint that data is unstructured
  - storage - key is a unique identifier and value is the data itself.

  ### Semi-Structured
  - is data that has structure and that is not tabular. eg Email
  - Every Email has structural components eg. recipient, sender, subject, date and time
  - body of email is unstructured text, while attachments can be anything type of file.

  ## Common File formats
  - facilitate data exchange and tool interoperability.
  - Text Files
  - Fixed-Width Files
  - JavaScript Object Notation
  - Extensible Markup Language (XML)
  - HyperText Markup Language (HTML)

# Data Preparation and Exploration
- Module focus
  - understand how to explore and acquire data
  - learn databases and need to classify and store or structure data
  - data manipulation techniques and how to manage data quality
  - fundamentals of stats and analysis techniques
 
  ## Databases and Data Acquisition
  - Two categories of databases
    - Relational - for storing and processing structured data
    - Nonrelational - 

    ### The Relational Model
    - The entity relationship diagram (ERD) is a visual of data modelling process, it shows the connection between related entities.
    - cardinality refers to the relationship between two entities.
    - unary relationship is when an entity has a connection with itself.
    - A binary relationship connects two entities
   
    ### Relational Databases
    - Relational databasess let you make operational system out of an ERD, Relational entities correspond to databases tables, and entity attributes correspond to table columns.
    - An associative table is both a table and a relationship
    - every row in a relational database must be unique
    - a prinmary key is one or more attributes that uniquely identify a specific row
    - a foreign key is or more columns in one table that points to corresponding columns in a related table, FK enforces referential integrity.
   
    RELATIONAL VS NON-RELATION
    - Relational - data consistency, security, ease of back up
    - Non-Relational - flexibility, high scalability, cost effective
   
    ### Non-Relational Databases
    - does not have a predefined strucure based or tabular data
    - examples
      - key-value database
        - key is globally unique across entire database
        - the data corresponding eith key can structured or ustructured
        - can scale to accomododate many simultaneous request without impacting perfomance.
      - Document
        - is similar to key-value database bbut the value is restricted to a specific structured format eg JSON
      - Column-Family
        - use an index to identify data in groups of related columns.
        - good ability to scale
      - Graph
        - specialize in exploring relationship between pieces of data.
        - each animal and person represent a node in the graph.
